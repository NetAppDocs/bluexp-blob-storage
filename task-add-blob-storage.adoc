| Field
| Description

| Storage account name | Enter the name you want to use for the storage account. The name must be between 3 and 24 characters in length, and it can contain numbers and lowercase letters only.

| Azure Region a| Select a region from the list where the storage account will be created.

Select the appropriate region for your storage account. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview[See the Microsoft documentation for information about Azure regions and availability zones^].

Not all regions are supported for all types of storage accounts or redundancy configurations. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy[See the Microsoft documentation for information about Azure Storage redundancy^].

Additionally, the choice of region can have a billing impact. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#storage-account-billing[See the Microsoft documentation for information about Azure Storage account billing^].

| Performance type a| Select whether you want to use *Standard* or *Premium* performance storage. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#types-of-storage-accounts[See the Microsoft documentation for information about Types of storage accounts^].

_Standard_ performance is used for general-purpose v2 storage accounts. This type of account is recommended for most scenarios. 

_Premium_ performance is used for scenarios that require low latency. There are three types of premium storage accounts are available: Block blobs, File shares, and Page blobs. 

|===

. In the _Tags_ section, enter up to 10 tag key/value pairs to group your resources. 

Tags are metadata that you can use to group resources to identify applications, environments, regions, cloud providers, and more. You can add tags to a storage account so that the tags are applied to objects when they are added to the storage account.

Tags are disabled by default in new storage account created by BlueXP. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-manage-find-blobs[Learn more about tagging from the Microsoft documentation^].

. In the _Encryption_ section, choose the type of data encryption you want to use to protect access to your data.
