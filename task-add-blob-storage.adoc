. In the _Instance details_ section, enter the name for the storage account, and select a region (or regions) where the storage account will be created.

| Field
| Description

| Storage account name | Enter the name you want to use for the storage account. The name must be between 3 and 24 characters in length, and it can contain numbers and lowercase letters only.

| Region a| Select a region from the list where the storage account will be created.

Select the appropriate region for your storage account. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview[See the Microsoft documentation for information about Azure regions and availability zones^].

Not all regions are supported for all types of storage accounts or redundancy configurations. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy[See the Microsoft documentation for information about Azure Storage redundancy^].

Additionally, the choice of region can have a billing impact. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#storage-account-billing[See the Microsoft documentation for information about Azure Storage account billing^].

| Performance type a| Select whether you want to use *Standard* or *Premium* performance storage. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#types-of-storage-accounts[See the Microsoft documentation for information about Types of storage accounts^].

_Standard_ performance is used for general-purpose v2 storage accounts. This type of account is recommended for most scenarios. 

_Premium_ performance is used for scenarios that require low latency. There are three types of premium storage accounts are available: Block blobs, File shares, and Page blobs.

. In the _Storage class_ section, select the storage class that will be used for objects in your bucket. You can select from among four storage classes, or you can select _Autoclass_ to have Google adjust the class as needed.

| Standard | Standard storage is best for data that is frequently accessed ("hot" data) and/or stored for only brief periods of time.

| Nearline | Nearline storage is a low-cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data.

| Coldline | Coldline storage is a very-low-cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data.

| Archive | Archive storage is the lowest-cost, highly durable storage service for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery.

| Autoclass | Autoclass automatically transitions objects in your bucket to the appropriate storage classes based on each object's access pattern.

The cost and retrieval fees are different for each storage class. https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes[See the Google Cloud documentation for more information about storage classes^].

. In the _Protection tools_ section, choose whether you want to use any data protection tools to protect objects in the bucket, or data encryption settings to protect access to your data.

| None |  By default, no protection tools are enabled on the bucket.

| Object versioning a| The bucket will retain a noncurrent object version each time you update, replace, or delete a live object version - continuously maintaining a protected version of the object. When you select "Object versioning" you can specify two options:

* *Max. num. of versions per object* - Enter the number of noncurrent versions per object that will be created. 
* *Expire noncurrent versions after* - Enter the number of days after which the older, noncurrent objects will be removed. 

| Retention policy a| A retention policy ensures that all current and future objects in the bucket cannot be deleted or replaced until they reach the age you define in the retention policy. When you select "Retention policy" you can specify two options:

* *Retain objects for* - Enter the number of seconds, days, months, or years that objects will be retained.
* *Time frame* - Select whether the time is in seconds, days, months, or years.

| Google-managed encryption key | By default, Google-managed encryption keys are used to used to encrypt your data. 

| Customer-managed encryption key (CMEK)  | You can use your own customer-managed keys for data encryption instead of using the default Google-managed encryption keys. If you're planning to use your own customer-managed keys you'll need to have the Key Ring and the Key Name so you can add this information in the activation wizard. Learn more about customer-managed encryption keys.
