Once your Azure Blob Storage working environment is available in the Canvas, you can change some storage account properties directly from BlueXP.

Note that you can't change the bucket name, AWS account, region, or object lock setting.

The bucket properties you can change include:

* Whether Versioning is enabled or disabled for all objects in the bucket.
* You can choose to apply tags to the objects that are added to the bucket.
* Whether or not new objects added to the bucket are Encrypted, and the option used for encryption.

You can change these bucket settings directly from BlueXP by clicking image:button-horizontal-more.gif[the three dots more button] > *Manage details* for a bucket.

. Click *Save* and the changes to the bucket are submitted.

== Add or change tags for objects in the bucket

. In the _Tags_ section, enter up to 10 tag key/value pairs to group your resources. 
+
Tags are metadata that you can use to group resources to identify applications, environments, regions, cloud providers, and more. You can add tags to a storage account so that the tags are applied to objects when they are added to the storage account.
+
Tags are disabled by default in new storage account created by BlueXP. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-manage-find-blobs[Learn more about tagging from the Microsoft documentation^].

. Click *Save* and the changes to the bucket are submitted.


Tags are metadata that you can use to group resources to identify applications, environments, regions, cloud providers, and more. Tags consists of a tag key and a tag value. You can add tags to a bucket so that the tags are applied to objects when they are added to the bucket. You can also change and delete tags and tag values.

Tags are disabled by default in new buckets created by BlueXP. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-tagging.html[Learn more about tagging from the Amazon S3 documentation^].

After you add a tag, click *Apply* to save your changes. If you want to add more tags, click *Add new tag*. You can add up to 10 tags per bucket.

== Change the encryption setting

. In the _Encryption_ section, choose the type of data encryption you want to use to protect access to your data.

| Data encryption type
| Description

| Microsoft-managed keys | By default, Microsoft-managed encryption keys are used to used to encrypt your data. 

| Customer-managed keys | You can use your own customer-managed keys for data encryption instead of using the default Microsoft-managed encryption keys. If you're planning to use your own customer-managed keys, you'll need to have the Key Vault and the Keys so you can add this information in the activation wizard.

See the Microsoft Azure documentation for https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption[more information about Microsoft-managed keys^], and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/customer-managed-keys-overview[more information about Customer-managed keys^].

. Click *Save* and the changes to the bucket are submitted.



Server-side encryption enables you to encrypt data at the Amazon S3 destination. Amazon S3 encrypts your data at the object level as it writes it to disk, and it decrypts it for you when you access it. You can change the encryption setting used for future objects when they are added to the bucket.

Encryption is enabled by default using "Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)" in new buckets created by BlueXP. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html[Learn more about server-side encryption from the Amazon S3 documentation^].

Alternatively, you can choose to enable encryption using the "AWS Key Management Service key (SSE-KMS)". Encryption is also possible using your own customer-provided keys (SSE-C), but this functionality is unavailable through the BlueXP UI - you'll need to use the Amazon interface.

If you choose "AWS Key Management Service key (SSE-KMS)", you can choose an AWS KMS key that you've already created, or you can use an AWS KMS key ARN (Amazon Resource Name).
